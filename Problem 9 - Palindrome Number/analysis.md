### Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

### Analysis

In my initial code, there is no preliminary check to immediately return false for cases like negative numbers or numbers divisible by 10 (except for 0 itself). Instead, the code proceeds to iterate through the number regardless, reducing efficiency. The improved code begins by verifying if `x` is a negative number or ends with 0 (excluding 0), and if so, returns false immediately. It then iterates, constructing a reversed version of the number and continuously checking if the `original` number is still greater than the `reversed` number. By the end of the iterations, if the `original` number matches the `reversed` number, it confirms the number as a palindrome. For numbers with an odd number of digits, the middle digit is discarded before the final comparison. If neither condition is met, the number is not a palindrome.

**Case 1**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Input:** x = 121\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Output:** true

**Case 2**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Input:** x = -121\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Output:** false

**Case 3**\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Input:** x = 10\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Output:** false
